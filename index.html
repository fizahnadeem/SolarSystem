    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Our solar system is a vast and dynamic expanse of celestial bodies, bound together by the immense gravitational pull of the Sun. Spanning approximately 4.6 billion years of cosmic history, it is home to eight planets, hundreds of moons, millions of asteroids, and countless comets, each contributing to the intricate balance of our cosmic neighborhood.

        At the center lies the Sun, a blazing sphere of hydrogen and helium, generating energy that sustains life on Earth and influences every planet in its orbit. Surrounding it are the inner rocky planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—small, dense worlds shaped by geological activity and atmospheric forces. Earth, the only known planet to support life, thrives due to its perfect balance of water, air, and temperature.
        
        Beyond the asteroid belt, where remnants from the early solar system orbit in silent solitude, the gas and ice giants—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—dominate the outer reaches. These massive worlds, surrounded by rings and moons, hold deep atmospheric mysteries and some of the most extreme environments known to science.
        
        Yet, the solar system extends far beyond Neptune. The Kuiper Belt is a vast region of icy bodies, home to Pluto and other dwarf planets, while the Oort Cloud, a distant shell of icy debris, is believed to be the origin of many long-period comets. These outermost regions remain largely unexplored, holding secrets about the formation and evolution of our cosmic home.
        
        For centuries, humans have gazed at the night sky, wondering about our place in the universe. With advancements in space exploration, telescopes, and robotic missions, we continue to unravel the mysteries of the solar system. From the first moon landing to the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life, every discovery brings us closer to understanding the forces that shaped our past and may define our future among the stars.
        
        Whether you are fascinated by planetary science, space exploration, or the possibility of life beyond Earth, the solar system offers endless wonders waiting to be explored. As we push the boundaries of space travel and technology, the journey to uncover the secrets of our celestial home has only just begun.</p>

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Sun is 99.8% of the Solar System’s Mass</b> – Almost all the mass in our solar system is concentrated in the Sun, making it the ultimate gravitational anchor.</li>
        
        <li><b>A Day on Venus is Longer Than a Year</b> – Venus takes <b>243 Earth days</b> to complete one rotation but only <b>225 Earth days</b> to orbit the Sun!</li>
        
        <li><b>Jupiter Has the Most Moons</b> – With <b>over 90 confirmed moons</b>, Jupiter holds the record for the most natural satellites orbiting a planet.</li>
        
        <li><b>Saturn Could Float on Water</b> – Saturn is the least dense planet in the solar system, meaning it <b>would float if there were a bathtub big enough</b> to hold it!</li>
        
        <li><b>Mars Has the Tallest Volcano</b> – Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system, is about <b>three times the height of Mount Everest</b>.</li>
        
        <li><b>Neptune Has Supersonic Winds</b> – Winds on Neptune can reach speeds of <b>2,100 km/h (1,300 mph)</b>—faster than the speed of sound on Earth!</li>
        
        <li><b>Pluto Was a Planet… and Then It Wasn’t</b> – Pluto was classified as a planet until 2006, when it was reclassified as a <b>dwarf planet</b> by the International Astronomical Union.</li>
        
        <li><b>The Asteroid Belt Has a “Dwarf Planet”</b> – <b>Ceres</b> is the largest object in the asteroid belt and is also classified as a <b>dwarf planet</b>.</li>
        
        <li><b>Mercury Has Ice</b> – Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury has <b>frozen water</b> in craters at its poles that never receive sunlight.</li>
        
        <li><b>Uranus Spins on Its Side</b> – Unlike other planets, Uranus rotates almost completely sideways, likely due to a massive collision in the past.</li>
        
        <li><b>A Year on Mercury is Just 88 Days</b> – Mercury orbits the Sun at high speed, making its year much shorter than Earth’s.</li>
        
        <li><b>Comets Are Like Dirty Snowballs</b> – Composed of ice, dust, and rock, comets leave behind <b>bright tails of gas and dust</b> when they approach the Sun.</li>
        
        <li><b>Earth is the Only Planet Not Named After a God</b> – Every other planet in the solar system is named after a <b>Roman deity</b>, except Earth.</li>
        
        <li><b>The Solar System is Moving Through Space</b> – The entire solar system orbits the <b>center of the Milky Way Galaxy</b>, taking about <b>225 million years</b> to complete one full revolution.</li>
        
        <li><b>Saturn’s Rings Are Younger Than the Dinosaurs</b> – Some studies suggest that <b>Saturn’s rings</b> might be <b>only 100 million years old</b>, meaning they didn’t exist when dinosaurs roamed Earth!</li>
